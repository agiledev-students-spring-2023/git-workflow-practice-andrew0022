# Paragraph
In this article we learn more about the layoffs that have been happening in tech corporations around 2022. When we hear about these layoffs, many times we just associate them with people working in software engineering, however, when companies and writers mention "tech layoffs", "tech" can refer to any type of position in a tech company, not just a developer. Many of the positions that were hit hard and even harder than software engineers include, recruiting, non-HR recruiting, finance, and operations. There was a larger percentage of people laid off in these fields versus software engineering. For reference, only about 10% of software engineers were laid off while 50% of workers in recruiting were fired. 

# Tony Kim's comment
With the statistics provided by Andrew above, we can see that combining all the different departments and jobs as "tech" can be misleading. However, we also see that software engineers are still heavily impacted by this lay off since it will mean higher expectations from new candidates due to less available positions.
